## Introduction

**EcoSight** üåçüì±üåø is a cutting-edge application combining **IoT, cloud computing**, and mobile technologies to deliver real-time plant health analysis and species identification. Designed for biodiversity enthusiasts and researchers, EcoSight leverages **infrared imagery captured via Raspberry Pi** and advanced cloud processing to evaluate the health of plants and classify them based on their species.

With EcoSight, users can:
- Capture infrared images of plants.
- Obtain real-time health indices like NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index).
- Identify plant species through AI-based classification in the cloud.

This app bridges the gap between advanced ecological monitoring and user accessibility, transforming every user into a biodiversity guardian. All data, including infrared indices, plant species, timestamps, and geolocations, are synchronized to the cloud and presented in an intuitive iOS application. The app also provides a personalized dashboard for users to track their activity and analyze trends.

## Technologies Used
- **Infrared Camera (Raspberry Pi NoIR 8MP)**: Captures spectral data for plant health evaluation.
- **Raspberry Pi 4 Model B**: Manages data capture and communication with the cloud.
- **MQTT/REST API**: Facilitates secure data transmission between devices and the cloud.
- **Azure Cloud Services**: Processes infrared indices (e.g., NDVI) and performs CNN-based plant classification.
- **iOS Application (Swift)**: Displays results, including health analysis and historical data.
- **Core Location API**: Captures geolocation data from the user's iPhone.
